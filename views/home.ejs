    <h3>What is Ogre?</h3>
    <p>Ogre is a web client (service) that translates spatial files into <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> using the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html">ogr2ogr</a> command line tool for use in JavaScript web applications and frameworks (like <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>).
    <h3>What formats does it support?</h3>
    <p>Currently Ogre supports the following transformations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"ESRI Shapefile"
            <ul>
                <li>a single .shp file <i>or</i>
                <li>a .zip file containing at least .shp, .dbf, and .shx
            </ul>
        <li>"MapInfo File"
            <ul>
                <li>a .zip file containing a .tab, .map, .id, and .dat
            </ul>
        <li>"TIGER" - .rtx where x is any number
        <li>"S57"
        <li>"DGN"
        <li>"BNA"
        <li>"CSV"
        <li>"GML"
        <li>"GPX"
        <li>"KML"
        <li>"KMZ"
        <li>"Interlis 1"
            <ul>
                <li>a single .itf file <i>or</i>
                <li>a .zip file containing .itf and .ili
            </ul>
        <li>"GMT"
        <li>"DXF"
        <li>"Geoconcept"
        <li>"GeoRSS"
        <li>"GPSTrackMaker"
    </ul>
    <h3>What are its limitations?</h3>
    <p>Ogre currently has an output size limit, which should be only be problem with large datasets.  This tool is made for smaller datasets.</p>
    <p>GPX, GeoConcept, and GPSTrackMaker have not been verified to work since I haven't been able to find any sample data.  My gut is they should work fine because of how ogr2ogr handles those files.  Please file an issue if you have any problems.
    <h3>Accessing Ogre using a POST request</h3>
    <p>You can perform Ogre transformations directly by making a HTTP POST request to <code>http://ogre.adc4gis.com/convert</code> with the following params:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>upload</code> - the file being uploaded
        <li><code>callback</code> (optional) - a JSONP callback function name
        <li><code>forcePlainText</code> (optional) - force return type to "text/plain" instead of "application/json"
    </ul>
