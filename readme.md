### Building

(1) Ogre requires that you already have installed [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and the the following packages:

- [Express](http://expressjs.com)
- [ejs](http://github.com/visionmedia/ejs)

- [connect](http://github.com/senchalabs/connect)

You can easily install these modules using the [Node Package Manager (npm)](http://github.com/isaacs/npm).
